> MongoDB versions older than 2.6 are not longer supported by ReactiveMongo, as the End of Life for MongoDB 2.4 was reached in [April 2015](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy).

### Logging

[SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) is used for the logging in ReactiveMongo. As soon as an appropriate binding is available at runtime, it will be used.

> Log4J is still required by the deprecated code, but is not used by ReactiveMongo.

In a Play application, the [Playframework logging](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaLoggin) will be used.
