[![Test coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-60%25-yellowgreen.svg)](reactivemongo.github.io/ReactiveMongo/coverage/0.12.0/)

> MongoDB versions older than 2.6 are not longer supported by ReactiveMongo, as the End of Life for MongoDB 2.4 was reached in [April 2015](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy).

**API documentations:**

The various API of the ReactiveMongo driver itself, and also of the related libraries, are available as online.

- [Driver API](../api/index.html): Core driver, BSON
- [Play JSON API](http://reactivemongo.github.io/ReactiveMongo-Play-Json/{{page.major_version}}/api/)
- [Play module API](http://reactivemongo.github.io/Play-ReactiveMongo/{{page.major_version}}/api/)
- ReactiveMongo [AkkaStream](https://reactivemongo.github.io/ReactiveMongo-Streaming/{{page.major_version}}/akka-stream/api/)
- ReactiveMongo [Iteratees](https://reactivemongo.github.io/ReactiveMongo-Streaming/{{page.major_version}}/iteratees/api/)

**Recommanded configuration:**

The driver core and the modules are tested in [container based environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Virtualization-environments), with the specs as bellow.

- 2 [cores](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (64bits)
- 4 GB of system memory, with a maximum of 2 GB for the JVM

This can be considered as a recommanded environment.
