## Monitoring

ReactiveMongo provides a mechanism to collect some metrics about MongoDB connections, that can be useful to monitor.

**Supported:**

- [JMX](#jmx)
- [Kamon](#kamon)
- [Datadog](#datadog)
- [Instana](#instana)

## JMX

A [JMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Management_Extensions) module is available.

When running with this module, you can check the state of the ReactiveMongo pools from outside the JVM, using a JMX client.

It can be enabled by adding the dependency as bellow.

```ocaml
"org.reactivemongo" %% "reactivemongo-jmx" % "{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}"
```

**Using JConsole:**

In order to monitor with `jconsole`, first start it and select the ReactiveMongo JVM.

The following warning may be display when connecting to a JVM without SSL (e.g. for local JVMs).

<img src="../images/jconsole2.png" alt="JConsole warning" class="screenshot" />

Once connected, you can select the "MBeans" tab on the top of JConsole, to check the beans managed in the JVM, including those representing the MongoDB nodes managed by ReactiveMongo.

## Kamon

[Kamon](https://kamon.io/) is an instrumentation and monitoring library for JVM application.

For projects where Kamon is [set up](https://kamon.io/docs/latest/guides/), the module `reactivemongo-kamon` can to added as bellow, to collect metrics about the connection pools.

```ocaml
"org.reactivemongo" %% "reactivemongo-kamon" % "{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}"
```

Then the metrics can be configured in dashboards, according the used Kamon reporters.
For example if using [Kamon APM](https://kamon.io/docs/latest/reporters/apm/).

<img src="../images/kamon-apm-graph-view.png" alt="Graph about established connections" class="screenshot" />

The collected metrics are the following.

**Spans/Events:** (tagged by pool name)

- `reactivemongo.pool-created`
- `reactivemongo.pool-updated`
- `reactivemongo.pool-stopped`

**Pool metrics:** (tagged by pool name)
- `reactivemongo.awaitingRequests`: Total number of requests awaiting to be processed by MongoDB nodes.
- `reactivemongo.maxAwaitingRequestsPerChannel`: Maximum number of requests that were awaiting to be processed for a single channel (see `maxInFlightRequestsPerChannel`).
- `reactivemongo.numberOfNodes`: Number of nodes that are part of the set.
- `reactivemongo.hasPrimary`: Indicates whether the primary node is known (0 or 1).
- `reactivemongo.hasNearest`: Indicates whether the nearest node is known (0 or 1).
- `reactivemongo.isMongos`: Indicates whether mongos is used (0 or 1).
- `reactivemongo.numberOfSecondaries`: Number of secondary nodes in the set.

**Node metrics:** (tagged by pool & node)
- `reactivemongo.nodeChannels`: Number of network channels to a same MongoDB node, whatever is the status (see `connectedChannels`).
- `reactivemongo.connectedChannels`: Number of connected channels to a same MongoDB node (see `nodeChannels`).
- `reactivemongo.authenticatedChannels`: Number of authenticated channels to a same MongoDB node (see `connectedChannels`).
- `reactivemongo.pingTime`: Response delay (in nanoseconds) for the last IsMaster request.

## Datadog

This library exposes the ReactiveMongo metrics using [StatsD integration for Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent).

```ocaml
"org.reactivemongo" %% "reactivemongo-datadog" % "{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}"
```

**Events:** (tagged by pool name)

- `reactivemongo.pool-created`
- `reactivemongo.pool-updated`
- `reactivemongo.pool-stopped`

**Pool metrics:** (tagged by pool name)

- `awaitingRequests`: Total number of requests awaiting to be processed by MongoDB nodes.
- `maxAwaitingRequestsPerChannel`: Maximum number of requests that were awaiting to be processed for a single channel (see `maxInFlightRequestsPerChannel`).
- `numberOfNodes`: Number of nodes that are part of the set.
- `hasPrimary`: Indicates whether the primary node is known (0 or 1).
- `hasNearest`: Indicates whether the nearest node is known (0 or 1).
- `isMongos`: Indicates whether mongos is used (0 or 1).
- `numberOfSecondaries`: Number of secondary nodes in the set.

**Node metrics:** (tagged by pool & node)

- `nodeChannels`: Number of network channels to a same MongoDB node, whatever is the status (see `connectedChannels`).
- `connectedChannels`: Number of connected channels to a same MongoDB node (see `nodeChannels`).
- `authenticatedChannels`: Number of authenticated channels to a same MongoDB node (see `connectedChannels`).
- `pingTime`: Response delay (in nanoseconds) for the last IsMaster request.

### Application configuration

The application using the driver must configure the Datadog monitoring using a file `application.conf` (or `reference.conf`), that [must be found in the classpath](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#conventional-configuration-files-for-jvm-apps).

The following settings are mandatory.

- `reactivemongo.datadog.hostname`: Host to the DatadogD agent for metric/event collection (e.g. `localhost`).
- `reactivemongo.datadog.port` (integer): UDP/StatsD port of the DatadogD agent (e.g. `8125`).

> If `reactivemongo.datadog.hostname` is missing, the monitoring is not started.

**Minimal configuration sample:**

```
reactivemongo {
  datadog {
    hostname = "localhost"
    port = 8125
  }
}
```

The following settings are optional (see [documentation](https://javadoc.io/static/com.datadoghq/java-dogstatsd-client/2.10.5/com/timgroup/statsd/NonBlockingStatsDClient.html#NonBlockingStatsDClient-java.lang.String-int-java.lang.String:A-com.timgroup.statsd.StatsDClientErrorHandler-java.util.concurrent.Callable-int-int-int-java.lang.String-int-int-int-boolean-boolean-int-)).

- `reactivemongo.datadog.name`: The name for the application host who send the metrics.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.prefix`: The prefix/namespace to be added to all the metric keys (default: `reactivemongo`).
- `reactivemongo.datadog.constantTags`: The tags to be added to all metrics.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.bufferPoolSize` (unsigned integer): The socket buffer size in bytes. Applies to unix sockets only.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.entityID`: The entity id value used with an internal tag for tracking client entity.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.queueSize` (unsigned integer): The maximum amount of unprocessed messages in the queue.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.senderWorkers` (unsigned integer): The number of sender worker threads submitting buffers to the socket.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.socketBufferSize` (unsigned integer): Applies to unix sockets only.
- `reactivemongo.datadog.timeout` (finite duration; e.g. 2 seconds = `2000`): The timeout in milliseconds. Applies to unix sockets only.
- Telemetry:
  * `reactivemongo.datadog.telemetry.enabled` (boolean; default `false`): Enable telemetry.
  * `reactivemongo.datadog.telemetry.hostname`: Telemetry hostname.
  * `reactivemongo.datadog.telemetry.port` (unsigned integer): Telemetry port, if enabled.

> Datadog metric collection is always set in non-blocking mode.

*See [complete example](https://github.com/ReactiveMongo/ReactiveMongo-Monitoring/blob/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/datadog/src/test/resources/application.conf)*

**Troubleshooting:**

This can be debuged using [Netcat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat), using an alternative port (e.g. `8126`), to ensure the monitoring is properly started: `nc -u -l 8126 | grep reactivemongo`; Must display StatsD entries as bellow.

```

```

### Agent configuration

The mandatory setting `reactivemongo.datadog.hostname` must correspond to the accessible network address or hostname of the Datadog agent (e.g. `localhost` if the application and the agent are on the same machine).

Also the setting `reactivemongo.datadog.port` must match the way the Datadog agent is configured for StatsD (e.g `8125` in the following example).

First, edit `datadog.yml` and add the following settings:

```yaml
use_dogstatsd: true
dogstatsd_port: 8125 # UDP
```

After the agent is restarted, this can be [tested from shell](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/datagram_shell/?tab=metrics).

```bash
while true; do ((echo -n "custom.metric.name:$RANDOM|c" | nc -4u -w1 ${DATADOGD_UDP_HOST} ${DATADOGD_UDP_PORT}) && sleep 1s); done
```
