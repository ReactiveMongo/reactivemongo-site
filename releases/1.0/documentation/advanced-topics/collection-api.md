## Collection API

The Collection API is designed to be very extensible, allowing the use of third-party libraries to build documents (e.g. use something else than the embedded BSON library).

For example, let consider the case of the [support of Play JSON](https://github.com/reactivemongo/reactivemongo-play-json), which relies on the [Play JSON library](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaJson) instead of the [BSON library](../bson/overview.html).

*BSON collection:*

{% highlight scala %}
// using the default Collection implementation
// (relying on the embedded BSON library)

import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

import reactivemongo.api.bson.{ BSONDocument, BSONDocumentReader, Macros }
import reactivemongo.api.bson.collection.BSONCollection

case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

object Person {
  implicit val reader: BSONDocumentReader[Person] = Macros.reader[Person]
}

def db1: reactivemongo.api.DB = ???

val collection1: BSONCollection = db1.collection("people")

// find people who are older than 25
val query1 =
  BSONDocument("age" -> BSONDocument("$gt" -> 25))

// run the query then convert the result to a `Person` instance
// using the implicit (BSON) reader
val result1: Future[Option[Person]] = collection1.find(query1).one[Person]
{% endhighlight %}

### The `Collection` trait

This trait is almost empty.

{% highlight scala %}
package simplified.api

import reactivemongo.api.DB

// simplified for the sake of readability
trait Collection {
  /** The database which this collection belong to. */
  def db: DB

  /** The name of the collection. */
  def name: String

  /** Gets the full qualified name of this collection. */
  def fullCollectionName = db.name + "." + name
}
{% endhighlight %}

All the collection implementations must mix this trait in. They also provide implicit objects of type `CollectionProducer` that make new (specialized) instances of them. Since `db.collection()` is parametrized with `C <: Collection` and accepts an implicit `CollectionProducer[C]`, the returned instance of collection can be inferred to the right type if there is only one producer in the implicit scope, which is a typical situation.

{% highlight scala %}
package simplifiedapi

import reactivemongo.api.{ Collection, CollectionProducer }

trait DB {
  def collection[C <: Collection](name: String)(implicit producer: CollectionProducer[C])
}
{% endhighlight %}

Most of the implementations actually extend the trait `GenericCollection`.

### The `GenericCollection` trait

This trait is much more complete than `Collection`. It defines common methods, like `find`, `update`, `delete` and `insert`, among others. One particularity of them is that they may be given ...

Let's take an example of how these types are used for `find()`, which is defined like this:

{% highlight scala %}
package simplifiedapi

trait GenericCollection {
  def serializationPack: reactivemongo.api.SerializationPack
  val pack = serializationPack

  def find[S](selector: S)(implicit sw: pack.Writer[S]): QueryBuilder

  sealed trait QueryBuilder { /* ... */ }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This function takes a `selector` (or query) of type `S`. This object is then transformed into BSON thanks to the implicit `swriter` parameter. Moreover, you can notice that the return type is another trait, `GenericQueryBuilder`, with the same parameter type

> A `GenericQueryBuilder`, like its name says it, helps building and customizing the query.

### Examples

- The default implementation in ReactiveMongo: [`BSONCollection`](../../api/index.html#reactivemongo.api.bson.collection.BSONCollection). It relies on the embedded BSON library, with `BSONDocumentReader` and `BSONDocumentWriter` as the de/serializer typeclasses.
- The implementation in the Play JSON support, [`JSONCollection`](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/reactivemongo/reactivemongo-play-json_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/reactivemongo-play-json_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}-{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}-javadoc.jar/!/index.html#reactivemongo.play.json.collection.JSONCollection). It uses `JsObject` (a JSON object), and the de/serializer typeclasses `Writes` and `Reads`.
