The various API of the ReactiveMongo driver itself, and also of the related libraries, are available online.

- [Driver API](https://javadoc.io/static/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/): Core driver, BSON
- [Play JSON API](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/reactivemongo/reactivemongo-play-json_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/reactivemongo-play-json_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}-{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}-javadoc.jar/!/index.html)
- [Play module API](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/reactivemongo/play2-reactivemongo_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/play2-reactivemongo_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}-{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}-javadoc.jar/!/index.html)
- ReactiveMongo [AkkaStream](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/reactivemongo/reactivemongo-akkastream_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/reactivemongo-akkastream_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}-{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}-javadoc.jar/!/index.html)
- ReactiveMongo [Iteratees](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/reactivemongo/reactivemongo-iteratees_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}/{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}/reactivemongo-iteratees_{{site._1_0_scala_major}}-{{site._1_0_latest_minor}}-javadoc.jar/!/index.html)

**Recommended configuration:**

The driver core and the modules are tested in a [container based environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Virtualization-environments), with the specifications as bellow.

- 2 [cores](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (64 bits)
- 4 GB of system memory, with a maximum of 2 GB for the JVM

This can be considered as a recommended environment.
